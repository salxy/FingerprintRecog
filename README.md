# FingerprintRecog
This is a fingerprint verification and identification program coded using Python.

1.1.	 Project Statement
Our team decided to write a program that performs biometric authentication through fingerprint recognition. Our program could easily verify and identify fingerprints. When given an input fingerprint, our program will return whom does the input fingerprint belong to; this is based on matching score of minutiae features.

1.2.	 Accomplished Objectives
Our primary goal was to utilize various libraries in Python to create a fingerprint recognition system. We aimed to create this program by implementing a handful of image processing filters explained throughout the course and applied during lab sessions. After a lot of hard work on working on this project and lots of research, we have created a program that satisfies us truly.
